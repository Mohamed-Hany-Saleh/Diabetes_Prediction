## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction application is designed to help predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health metrics. The model is trained on a dataset and uses machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the diabetes dataset
- Train a machine learning model to predict diabetes
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Make predictions on new data

## File Structure
